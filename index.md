### Hidden Markov Model for time series modelling of wage evolution

This project is dedicated to the development of code for my bachelor's thesis titled "Statistical analyses for time series modeling of wage evolution using Hidden Markov Models." The code primarily revolves around the implementation and visualization of Hidden Markov Models to analyze and predict wage changes over time.

### Analysis of Election Programmes with a Focus on Digitalization Using Text Mining Methods in R

For a term paper in my political science studies at Georg-August-Universität Göttingen, I conducted an analysis with R of the election programmes of the parties SPD and Grüne for the Lower Saxony state elections in 2022. I investigated the programmes with regard to their relevance to digitalization and employed various text mining methods for this purpose.
